You know, and that's what one thing I'm really excited about Outside Lands. I'm going to go there and spend the days watching music, and it's going to be fun. <turn>We're going to learn some new music. Rostam? Wait, I barely know him. Sampa the Great. Del Water Gap. Papa Roach. Cassandra Jenkins. <turn>Okay, Moisha, stop. <turn>Unusual Demont. There used to be another Demont. He was much more normal, but this one, unusual Demont. Oh, Pussy Riot's going to be there. They fought Putin!
