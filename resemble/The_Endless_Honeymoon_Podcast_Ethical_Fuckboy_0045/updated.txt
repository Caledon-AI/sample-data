Burning Man and was really wondering, like, what experience am I going to have? Am I going to enjoy myself? And if I don't enjoy myself not being able to have debaucherous sex with random burners, what was this experience to me? Was this just me chasing women this whole time? Like, how pathetic would that be? This thing I thought was a part of my identity was just like me being horny for twenty years. And the, I went and I stayed faithful and I had so much fun. In fact, in some ways, I had a different, but, but better kind of fun.
