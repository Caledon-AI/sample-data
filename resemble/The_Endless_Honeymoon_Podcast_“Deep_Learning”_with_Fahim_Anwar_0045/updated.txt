I was in quarantine. I was definitely doing dance videos, but that's what it takes. That's what I don't understand, like, moms with full lives who have time to do dancing videos. <turn>Because it's because they don't also have, uh, other careers, I mean, I think. <turn>Yes. <turn>Right. <turn>The stay at home mom on TikTok. <turn>Yeah. <turn>It's, yeah. <turn>They're, they're, they're focused on their, on their dance, on their TikTok brand. But you should do that. You're so good at dancing. <turn>Well, I don't. <turn>Then they come to your stand-up show. <turn>You think? <turn>You're a purist. See, I realized this about you in England, actually. You're a purist.
