this dream where you're like, you are using, but you don't get to experience the fun of being high. You just have the guilt of having relapsed and then you wake up. It's like the the shittiest thing in the world, but it's kind of like that. It's like you're not getting the love, I, for me, it was like you're not getting the, the, the, like, beauty of embracing your mom. You're actually just getting the, like, oh, no, I just got mom COVID. <turn>Wait, you have dreams about embracing your mom? <turn>I don't know. What are your dream? Who the fuck are you embracing? <turn>Not my mom. <turn>Who is it? Fucking Morris?
