That's depression, I guess. But the point is, as people get older, no, but the truth is as people get older, they they sometimes will get less cool. They'll get less uh they'll get less they'll get more rigid, more cantankerous, and less cool. I don't mean cool like hip. I mean cool like awesome. They get less awesome. And I think the point is to grow old in a graceful way where you stay awesome, but you don't try to cling to youth, but you try to cling to the things we should all be clinging to, which is the the finer things in life.
