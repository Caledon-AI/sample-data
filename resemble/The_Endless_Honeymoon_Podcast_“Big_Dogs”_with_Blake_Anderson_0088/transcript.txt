you don't deserve that. But I mean, I don't know you that well. I mean, again, we've established you don't know me either. But like, I think you deserve more than that. I think you deserve a, a, a, to be in a relationship with somebody that like, that knows they want to be with you, you know? But I think ultimately, you, you're the only one that can do that math, which is like, okay, I can just deal with somebody that every couple months like rejects me and says, because honestly, like a lot of bisexual people are in monogamous relationships with one gender or the other. It's not like that this is the first time that's ever happened. Like, <turn>Tell her you're down for an open relationship!
