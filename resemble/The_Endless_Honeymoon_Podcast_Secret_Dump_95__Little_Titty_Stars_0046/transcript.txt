That's where men go to get their haircut. They don't like women in there. It's for men only. And she was like, "Why for men?" I'm like, "Eh, they just like..." And then remember you went to a barber shop for a while and they said like, "No wives." Like there was like a sign that said, "No wives, please." I just think, as a woman, why do you want to work for, for like a men's only club? <turn>Do you think that boys dress in blue and girls dress in pink? <turn>A barber shop is for men. It's like where men can go to like get their nostril hairs...
