you know, uh, uh, said I'm going to be a dad too, blah, blah, blah. Whatever it was, it was in the book. They kept reading it to this kid every night, every night, with enough sort of hints that the kid started to become like obsessed with hearing it. And then one day, the kid closed the book and said, "Is this story about me?" And they said, "Yeah, it is." And that is how that kid slowly learned his, his origin story. And so <turn>We don't know if that worked, though. <turn>We do know that it worked. What do you mean?
