and another family gave us a call. Now, by the way, this wasn't my idea. I can't even be blamed for this. Another family gave us a call, uh, this is the Clooney family, uh, George and Amalya, uh, and they asked if we wanted to go backpacking, like, real camping, like, full pack, thirty-five to fifty-pound backpack, to treacherous hike in. And Natasha said yes and we went freaking backpacking, dude. <turn>They didn't they didn't say the treacherous part. <turn>We got Leggero in a backpack.
