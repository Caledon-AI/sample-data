You get a divorce. <turn>I wouldn't divorce you, but I'd be like, "What's happening?" Like, "Are you okay? That's weird." Not if I rolled over and you were you were masturbating in bed. I would be like, "Oh, she's doing her thingy thing," and what not. <turn>But not looking at you while I was doing it. <turn>If you were standing up, staring, fluttering your butterfly. <turn>What if I just wanted to writhe on your body while you were sleeping? <turn>That's different. You trying to come come onto me? Okay, that's cool. You can definitely you have permission to take advantage of me while I'm unconscious. I might not be down.
