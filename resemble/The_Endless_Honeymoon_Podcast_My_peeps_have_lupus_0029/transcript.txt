at like six PM I got this message. This person was like, "Are you really giving away turkeys?" And I was like, "Yeah, send me your email uh send me your address and I'll get you a turkey." And she's like, "Oh, actually, I'm not I don't need a turkey. I don't even celebrate Thanksgiving. I'm actually South African. And um I just was touched to see that somebody was doing something nice." I was like, "Okay." I mean, I just read that and I was like, "Okay." And then she wrote this other message after that. It was like super long scroll down kind of message. <turn>She lives in South Africa. <turn>Live
