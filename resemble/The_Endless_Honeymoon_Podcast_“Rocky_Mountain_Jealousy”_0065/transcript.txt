a lot of insecurity about this new work environment. I you're you're a grown-up and you're your own woman, and I don't have the right to tell you anything. I know that. I just want to be honest with you about the way that I'm feeling. I'm feeling like you what? What why you laughing at me? <turn>I'm sorry. I just cannot get over having to go for six days with like five best friends who are like bros from the nineties who are like trying to pressure me into having sex. Like that sounds so toxic. <turn>Wait, what where did this pressure you into having sex thing come from?
