If you <turn>And <turn>want, and by the way, if you want to model anything, your boyfriend's the perfect guy. He can three D print up a model in just an hour or two. I think <turn>And, and, and hold on, one more thing, because I also have this vision of like you and your daughter having your dinners, and then he goes and does his own thing. Like, I don't know. If you're okay with that, that's, that's fine. But, like, what's your expectation? Do you want to, do you want to be a family? Do you want to have two or three nights a week where you all three eat dinner and, and you need to let him know that or, or get it clear in your head. What were you going to say, Moshe? <turn>That was a good question.
