In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative\ndemands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior\nantitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a\nlawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising.\nSeparately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On June 22, 2021, the EC opened a formal investigation into\nGoogle's advertising technology business practices. On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an\nantitrust complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s\noperation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We\nbelieve these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General\ncontinue their investigations into certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state\nregulators in the U.S., the EC and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result\nin a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on\nimportation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into\nthe U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nIn 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java\napplication programming interfaces (Java APIs). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of\nGoogle on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March\n27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29,\n2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the\npetition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the\nSupreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the\nSolicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On\nNovember 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme\nCourt heard oral arguments in our case on October 7, 2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal\nCircuit's ruling and found that Google\u2019s use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter of law. The Supreme Court\nremanded the case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion. On May\n14, 2021, the Federal Circuit entered an order affirming the district court\u2019s final judgment in favor of Google. On June\n21, 2021, the Federal Circuit issued a mandate returning the case to the district court, and the case is now concluded.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and\nconsent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we have a\nnumber of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions.

We have agreed to hold\ncertain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual\nproperty infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within\nwhich an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into\nindemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to\nour agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows\nin a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant\njudgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to\nsuch matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of\noutstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either\nindividually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and\nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac2.4 billion\n($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and\non September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's\ndecision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the\nGeneral Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January\n20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and\non October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14,\n2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by\n$217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google\nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements,\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending.\nWe recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally.

We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further\ndetails on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 \u201cBusiness\u201d and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nThe following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate\nthat they will continue to affect our future results:\n\u2022Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues\nsince inception. We expect that this shift to an online world will continue to benefit our business and our revenues,\nalthough at a slower pace than we have experienced historically, in particular after the outsized growth in our\nadvertising revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement\nand advertisers, which may affect our revenues.\n\u2022Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which\nallows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nOur users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables, and\nsmart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are\nfocused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our\nbusiness.\nWe benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising\nformats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional\ndesktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues\nmay be affected. For example, growth in the global smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including\nincreased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nWe expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow\nand TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic\nmix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product\nmix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nWe expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\n\u2022As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our\nmonetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to\nexpand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect our monetization. For example,\nrevenues from ads on YouTube and Google Play monetize at a lower rate than our traditional search ads. We also may\ndevelop new products incorporating AI innovations that could affect our monetization trends. Additionally, when\ndeveloping new products and services we generally focus first on user experience before prioritizing monetization.\n\u2022As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets\ncontinue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange\nrates affect such revenues.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S.,\nincluding in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our\nproducts and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\n26"}, {"source": "Google_FY2022_10K", "page_number": 31, "full_page_text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\n\u2022compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer\nservice functions; and\n\u2022spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\n\u2022compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and other\nadministrative support functions;\n\u2022expenses relating to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\n\u2022third-party services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and other outsourced administrative\nservices.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency\nexchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and non-marketable securities,\nperformance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\nFor additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in the\nvalue of our investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,\nItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\nRisk\u201d.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in\nthe U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

Goodwill\nimpairments were not material for the periods presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis\ngenerally over periods ranging from one to twelve years, and are subsequently removed from the presentation of gross\nintangible assets and accumulated amortization once they are fully amortized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes\npayable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of\nevents that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets\nbased on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely\nthan not that they will not be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax\nIncome provision as a current period expense.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on\ntechnical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the\nfinancial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be\nrealized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the\npurchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values,\nexcept for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The\nexcess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nForeign Currency\nWe translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange\nrates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for\nrevenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders\u2019\nequity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction\ncurrency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in other income (expense),\nnet.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\n58"}]}
