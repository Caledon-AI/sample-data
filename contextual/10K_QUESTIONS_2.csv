Amazon,Logical Reasoning,"Are Amazon's gross margins historically consistent (not fluctuating more than roughly 2% each year)? If gross margins are not a relevant metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Yes, they are fairly consistent with an upward trend, indicating moderate growth year over year. Their gross margins for 2021, 2022, and 2023 respectively were 42.03%, 43.81%, and 46.98%. Although in 2023 there was about a 3% increase from the prior year, I still believe that it is in line with being consistent in performing better than the last year as well as the fact that 2023 was the first full year for most countries where covid restrictions were finally relaxed. With respect to how relevant the gross margin metric is to Amazon, the company states themselves that they believe operating margin is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.","The gross margin (GM) formula is (revenue - cost of sales) / revenue. Using this formula, the following GM's were computed for 2021, 2022, and 2023:
FY2021 GM = (469,822 - 272,344) / 469,822 = 42.03%
FY2022 GM = (513,983 - 288,831) / 513,983 = 43.81%
FY2023 GM = (574,785 - 304,739) / 574,785 = 46.98%

Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate
activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud
offerings, lessors and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property
infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an
indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification
agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a
limited history of prior indemnification claims, and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid
indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably
possible.
Legal Matters
Antitrust Investigations
On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various
antitrust-related complaints against us.
On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and
ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion
($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and
on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's
decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the
General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January
20, 2022.
On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution
agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,
2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On
October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of
$5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018.
On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google
had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5
billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements,
which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge
of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.
While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on
our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by
regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions. In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative
demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior
antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a
lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising.
Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state
deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On June 22, 2021, the EC opened a formal investigation into
Google's advertising technology business practices. On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an
antitrust complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s
operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We
believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General
continue their investigations into certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state
regulators in the U.S., the EC and other regulators around the world.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that
certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these
lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders
preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change
our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for
us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly
become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result
in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on
importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into
the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.
Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against
certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,
and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our
customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions
or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.
In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of
California, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java
application programming interfaces (Java APIs). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of
Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March
27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29,
2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the
petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the
Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the
Solicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On
November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme
Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7, 2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal
Circuit's ruling and found that Google’s use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter of law. The Supreme Court
remanded the case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion. On May
14, 2021, the Federal Circuit entered an order affirming the district court’s final judgment in favor of Google. On June
21, 2021, the Federal Circuit issued a mandate returning the case to the district court, and the case is now concluded.
Other
We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and
consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and
employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or
publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we have a
number of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such claims, suits, regulatory and
government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in substantial fines and penalties,
injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our
business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could
harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We
record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably
estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we
disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of
liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make
adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the
estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.
With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of
reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently
unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.

Revenue Backlog
As of December 31, 2022, we had $64.3 billion of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”),
primarily related to Google Cloud. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future
services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. The amount and timing of revenue recognition for these
commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our
customers utilize services, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect to recognize such
as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months
with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded
as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one
year or less and cancellable contracts.
Deferred Revenue
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including
amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. Total deferred
revenue as of December 31, 2021 was $3.8 billion, of which $2.5 billion was recognized as revenues for the year
ending December 31, 2022.
