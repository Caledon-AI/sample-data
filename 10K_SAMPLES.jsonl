In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,developers, enterprises, \nand content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offerprograms that enable se\nllers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians,filmmakers, skill and \napp developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broadset of on-demand technology se\nrvices, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sellelectronic devices. \nIn addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsoredads, display, and video advertis\ning.We have organized our oper\nations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS.

Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of finan\ncial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets andliabilities, revenu\nes and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates areused for, but not limited to, \nincome taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-basedcompensation forfeitu\nre rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, and valuation and impairment of investments. Given the globaleconomic climate \nand additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic, these estimates have become more challenging, and actual results coulddiffer materially from these estimates.\nWe review the useful liv\nes of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2020 we changed our estimate of the useful life for our servers fromthree years to four yea\nrs. The longer useful life is due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs.

In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative\ndemands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior\nantitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a\nlawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising.\nSeparately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against Google in\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On June 22, 2021, the EC opened a formal investigation into\nGoogle's advertising technology business practices. On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an\nantitrust complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s\noperation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We\nbelieve these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General\ncontinue their investigations into certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state\nregulators in the U.S., the EC and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result\nin a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on\nimportation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into\nthe U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nIn 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of\nCalifornia, alleging that Google's Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java\napplication programming interfaces (Java APIs). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in favor of\nGoogle on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on March\n27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29,\n2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the\npetition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the\nSupreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September 27, 2019, the\nSolicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On\nNovember 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. The Supreme\nCourt heard oral arguments in our case on October 7, 2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal\nCircuit's ruling and found that Google\u2019s use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter of law. The Supreme Court\nremanded the case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion. On May\n14, 2021, the Federal Circuit entered an order affirming the district court\u2019s final judgment in favor of Google.

The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect\nto voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock\nis entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law.\nShares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically\nconvert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nShare Repurchases\nIn April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion of its\nClass C stock. In July 2021, the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization, permitting the\ncompany to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and\nits stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading\nprices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of December 31, 2021, $17.4 billion remains available for\nClass A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization.\nIn accordance with the authorizations of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the years ended December 31,\n2020 and 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 21.5 million and 20.3 million aggregate shares for $31.1\nbillion and $50.3 billion, respectively. Of the aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during 2021, 1.2\nmillion shares were Class A stock for $3.4 billion.\nStock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend (\u201cStock Split\u201d)\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20-for-\none stock split in the form of a one-time special stock dividend on each share of the Company\u2019s Class A, Class B, and\nClass C stock. The Stock Split is subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to the Company\u2019s Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A, Class B, and Class C\nstock to accommodate the Stock Split.\n78"}, {"source": "Google_FY2021_10K", "page_number": 79, "full_page_text": "Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\nIf approval is obtained, each of the Company\u2019s stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 (the\n\u201cRecord Date\u201d), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of the same\nclass of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A, Class B, and Class C stock using the two-class method. Basic net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net\nincome per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other\ncontingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and other contingently issuable\nshares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the\ndiluted net income per share of Class A stock assumes the conversion of Class B stock, while the diluted net income\nper share of Class B stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock\nare identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of\nincorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our Board of Directors from declaring or paying unequal per\nshare dividends on our Class A, Class B, and Class C stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a\ngiven class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment.

We have agreed to hold\ncertain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual\nproperty infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within\nwhich an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into\nindemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to\nour agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the\npayments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations,\ncash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future\npayments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows\nin a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be\nestimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect\nthe amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses\ndisclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. Significant\njudgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to\nsuch matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of\noutstanding legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either\nindividually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrust-related complaints against us.\nOn June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and\nranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac2.4 billion\n($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the General Court, and\non September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's\ndecision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On November 10, 2021, the\nGeneral Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice on January\n20, 2022.\nOn July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Android-related distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30,\n2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and\non October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14,\n2022, the General Court reduced the fine from \u20ac4.3 billion to \u20ac4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by\n$217 million in 2022.\nOn March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google\nhad with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of \u20ac1.5\nbillion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements,\nwhich we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which remains pending.\nWe recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.\nFrom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition\nmatters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally.

The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. Further, in June 2022, the\nAustralian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and\nMarkets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n\u2022On December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state\ndeceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along\nwith a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint alleging that Google\u2019s digital advertising\ntechnology products violate U.S. antitrust laws. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal\ninvestigation into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and\nJune 29, 2022, respectively.\n\u2022On July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each\nopened investigations into Google Play\u2019s business practices. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's\nbilling practices, most recently opening a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app\nstore billing regulations.\nWe believe these complaints are without merit and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate\nwith federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these\nlawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders\npreventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change\nour business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for\nus and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly\nbecome an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result\nin a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on\nimportation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into\nthe U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims,\nand may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our\ncustomers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions\nor otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent\norders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and\nemployment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or\npublishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we currently\nhave a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. We also periodically have data\nincidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government\ninvestigations, other proceedings, and consent orders could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief,\nongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models\nand operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding\npenalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including\nthose of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\n75"}]}
